# TypeScript Declarations

This directory contains custom type declarations for packages that do not have official type
declarations published to DefinitelyTyped (`@types/*`).

- [Declaration Files Introduction](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html)
- [Example Templates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-d-ts.html)

## Adding a new declaration file

1. Create a new directory matching a package name you want to create the type declarations for.
2. Run `projen synth` to scaffold the typing directory.
3. Fill in the `index.d.ts` file that was created in the directory.
